# # Operations on word vectors
# 
# Welcome to your first assignment of this week! 
# 
# Because word embeddings are very computionally expensive to train, most ML practitioners will load a pre-trained set of embeddings. 
# 
# **After this assignment you will be able to:**
# 
# - Load pre-trained word vectors, and measure similarity using cosine similarity
# - Use word embeddings to solve word analogy problems such as Man is to Woman as King is to ______. 
# - Modify word embeddings to reduce their gender bias 
# 
# Let's get started! Run the following cell to load the packages you will need.

# In[1]:

import numpy as np
from w2v_utils import *


# Next, lets load the word vectors. For this assignment, we will use 50-dimensional GloVe vectors to represent words. Run the following cell to load the `word_to_vec_map`. 

# In[2]:

words, word_to_vec_map = read_glove_vecs('../../readonly/glove.6B.50d.txt')


# You've loaded:
# - `words`: set of words in the vocabulary.
# - `word_to_vec_map`: dictionary mapping words to their GloVe vector representation.
# 
# You've seen that one-hot vectors do not do a good job capturing what words are similar. GloVe vectors provide much more useful information about the meaning of individual words. Lets now see how you can use GloVe vectors to decide how similar two words are. 
# 
# 

# # 1 - Cosine similarity
# 
# To measure how similar two words are, we need a way to measure the degree of similarity between two embedding vectors for the two words. Given two vectors $u$ and $v$, cosine similarity is defined as follows: 
# 
# $$\text{CosineSimilarity(u, v)} = \frac {u . v} {||u||_2 ||v||_2} = cos(\theta) \tag{1}$$
# 
# where $u.v$ is the dot product (or inner product) of two vectors, $||u||_2$ is the norm (or length) of the vector $u$, and $\theta$ is the angle between $u$ and $v$. This similarity depends on the angle between $u$ and $v$. If $u$ and $v$ are very similar, their cosine similarity will be close to 1; if they are dissimilar, the cosine similarity will take a smaller value.

# <caption><center> **Figure 1**: The cosine of the angle between two vectors is a measure of how similar they are</center></caption>
# 
# **Exercise**: Implement the function `cosine_similarity()` to evaluate similarity between word vectors.
# 
# **Reminder**: The norm of $u$ is defined as $ ||u||_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} u_i^2}$

In detail, we are trying to find a word *d*, such that the associated word vectors $e_a, e_b, e_c, e_d$ are related in the following manner: $e_b - e_a \approx e_d - e_c$. We will measure the similarity between $e_b - e_a$ and $e_d - e_c$ using cosine similarity.

# ### Congratulations!
# 
# You've come to the end of this assignment. Here are the main points you should remember:
# 
# - Cosine similarity a good way to compare similarity between pairs of word vectors. (Though L2 distance works too.) 
# - For NLP applications, using a pre-trained set of word vectors from the internet is often a good way to get started. 
# 
# Even though you have finished the graded portions, we recommend you take a look too at the rest of this notebook. 
# 
# Congratulations on finishing the graded portions of this notebook! 
# 

# ## 3 - Debiasing word vectors (OPTIONAL/UNGRADED) 

# In the following exercise, you will examine gender biases that can be reflected in a word embedding, and explore algorithms for reducing the bias. In addition to learning about the topic of debiasing, this exercise will also help hone your intuition about what word vectors are doing. This section involves a bit of linear algebra, though you can probably complete it even without being expert in linear algebra, and we encourage you to give it a shot. This portion of the notebook is optional and is not graded. 
# 
# Lets first see how the GloVe word embeddings relate to gender. You will first compute a vector $g = e_{woman}-e_{man}$, where $e_{woman}$ represents the word vector corresponding to the word *woman*, and $e_{man}$ corresponds to the word vector corresponding to the word *man*. The resulting vector $g$ roughly encodes the concept of "gender". (You might get a more accurate representation if you compute $g_1 = e_{mother}-e_{father}$, $g_2 = e_{girl}-e_{boy}$, etc. and average over them. But just using $e_{woman}-e_{man}$ will give good enough results for now.) 
# 

# In[8]:

g = word_to_vec_map['woman'] - word_to_vec_map['man']
print(g)


# Now, you will consider the cosine similarity of different words with $g$. Consider what a positive value of similarity means vs a negative cosine similarity. 

# In[9]:

print ('List of names and their similarities with constructed vector:')

# girls and boys name
name_list = ['john', 'marie', 'sophie', 'ronaldo', 'priya', 'rahul', 'danielle', 'reza', 'katy', 'yasmin']

for w in name_list:
    print (w, cosine_similarity(word_to_vec_map[w], g))


# As you can see, female first names tend to have a positive cosine similarity with our constructed vector $g$, while male first names tend to have a negative cosine similarity. This is not suprising, and the result seems acceptable. 
# 
# But let's try with some other words.

# In[10]:

print('Other words and their similarities:')
word_list = ['lipstick', 'guns', 'science', 'arts', 'literature', 'warrior','doctor', 'tree', 'receptionist', 
             'technology',  'fashion', 'teacher', 'engineer', 'pilot', 'computer', 'singer']
for w in word_list:
    print (w, cosine_similarity(word_to_vec_map[w], g))


# Do you notice anything surprising? It is astonishing how these results reflect certain unhealthy gender stereotypes. For example, "computer" is closer to "man" while "literature" is closer to "woman". Ouch! 
# 
# We'll see below how to reduce the bias of these vectors, using an algorithm due to [Boliukbasi et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06520). Note that some word pairs such as "actor"/"actress" or "grandmother"/"grandfather" should remain gender specific, while other words such as "receptionist" or "technology" should be neutralized, i.e. not be gender-related. You will have to treat these two type of words differently when debiasing.
# 
# ### 3.1 - Neutralize bias for non-gender specific words 
# 
# The figure below should help you visualize what neutralizing does. If you're using a 50-dimensional word embedding, the 50 dimensional space can be split into two parts: The bias-direction $g$, and the remaining 49 dimensions, which we'll call $g_{\perp}$. In linear algebra, we say that the 49 dimensional $g_{\perp}$ is perpendicular (or "orthogonal") to $g$, meaning it is at 90 degrees to $g$. The neutralization step takes a vector such as $e_{receptionist}$ and zeros out the component in the direction of $g$, giving us $e_{receptionist}^{debiased}$. 
# 
# Even though $g_{\perp}$ is 49 dimensional, given the limitations of what we can draw on a screen, we illustrate it using a 1 dimensional axis below. 
# 
# <img src="images/neutral.png" style="width:800px;height:300px;">
# <caption><center> **Figure 2**: The word vector for "receptionist" represented before and after applying the neutralize operation. </center></caption>
# 
# **Exercise**: Implement `neutralize()` to remove the bias of words such as "receptionist" or "scientist". Given an input embedding $e$, you can use the following formulas to compute $e^{debiased}$: 
# 
# $$e^{bias\_component} = \frac{e \cdot g}{||g||_2^2} * g\tag{2}$$
# $$e^{debiased} = e - e^{bias\_component}\tag{3}$$
# 
# If you are an expert in linear algebra, you may recognize $e^{bias\_component}$ as the projection of $e$ onto the direction $g$. If you're not an expert in linear algebra, don't worry about this.
# 
# <!-- 
# **Reminder**: a vector $u$ can be split into two parts: its projection over a vector-axis $v_B$ and its projection over the axis orthogonal to $v$:
# $$u = u_B + u_{\perp}$$
# where : $u_B = $ and $ u_{\perp} = u - u_B $

# ### 3.2 - Equalization algorithm for gender-specific words
# 
# Next, lets see how debiasing can also be applied to word pairs such as "actress" and "actor." Equalization is applied to pairs of words that you might want to have differ only through the gender property. As a concrete example, suppose that "actress" is closer to "babysit" than "actor." By applying neutralizing to "babysit" we can reduce the gender-stereotype associated with babysitting. But this still does not guarantee that "actor" and "actress" are equidistant from "babysit." The equalization algorithm takes care of this. 
# 
# The key idea behind equalization is to make sure that a particular pair of words are equi-distant from the 49-dimensional $g_\perp$. The equalization step also ensures that the two equalized steps are now the same distance from $e_{receptionist}^{debiased}$, or from any other work that has been neutralized. In pictures, this is how equalization works: 
# 
# <img src="images/equalize10.png" style="width:800px;height:400px;">
# 
# 
# The derivation of the linear algebra to do this is a bit more complex. (See Bolukbasi et al., 2016 for details.) But the key equations are: 
# 
# $$ \mu = \frac{e_{w1} + e_{w2}}{2}\tag{4}$$ 
# 
# $$ \mu_{B} = \frac {\mu \cdot \text{bias_axis}}{||\text{bias_axis}||_2^2} *\text{bias_axis}
# \tag{5}$$ 
# 
# $$\mu_{\perp} = \mu - \mu_{B} \tag{6}$$
# 
# $$ e_{w1B} = \frac {e_{w1} \cdot \text{bias_axis}}{||\text{bias_axis}||_2^2} *\text{bias_axis}
# \tag{7}$$ 
# $$ e_{w2B} = \frac {e_{w2} \cdot \text{bias_axis}}{||\text{bias_axis}||_2^2} *\text{bias_axis}
# \tag{8}$$
# 
# 
# $$e_{w1B}^{corrected} = \sqrt{ |{1 - ||\mu_{\perp} ||^2_2} |} * \frac{e_{\text{w1B}} - \mu_B} {||(e_{w1} - \mu_{\perp}) - \mu_B||} \tag{9}$$
# 
# 
# $$e_{w2B}^{corrected} = \sqrt{ |{1 - ||\mu_{\perp} ||^2_2} |} * \frac{e_{\text{w2B}} - \mu_B} {||(e_{w2} - \mu_{\perp}) - \mu_B||} \tag{10}$$
# 
# $$e_1 = e_{w1B}^{corrected} + \mu_{\perp} \tag{11}$$
# $$e_2 = e_{w2B}^{corrected} + \mu_{\perp} \tag{12}$$
# 
#

# Please feel free to play with the input words in the cell above, to apply equalization to other pairs of words. 
# 
# These debiasing algorithms are very helpful for reducing bias, but are not perfect and do not eliminate all traces of bias. For example, one weakness of this implementation was that the bias direction $g$ was defined using only the pair of words _woman_ and _man_. As discussed earlier, if $g$ were defined by computing $g_1 = e_{woman} - e_{man}$; $g_2 = e_{mother} - e_{father}$; $g_3 = e_{girl} - e_{boy}$; and so on and averaging over them, you would obtain a better estimate of the "gender" dimension in the 50 dimensional word embedding space. Feel free to play with such variants as well.
